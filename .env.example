# APPLICATION
APPLICATION_TITLE="FastAPI Clean Architecture and DDD Template"
APPLICATION_SUMMARY="This is a Python microservice template using FastAPI, designed to follow Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles."
APPLICATION_DESCRIPTION="### ðŸš€ FastAPI Clean Architecture and DDD Template

This template provides a structured approach to building Python microservices with FastAPI, emphasizing Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It is ideal for developers looking to create scalable and maintainable applications.

This template includes:
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Clean Architecture**: A software design pattern that separates the concerns of the application, making it easier to maintain and test.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: A software design approach that focuses on modeling the domain of the application, ensuring that the business logic is at the core of the application.
- **Logging**: Configured logging for better observability and debugging.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easy management of environment variables for different deployment environments (development, homologation, production).
- **Security**: Basic security setup with API key authentication.

Ideal for building robust and scalable microservices in Python.
